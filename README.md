# Crystal Collector

Dinosaur crystal collector themed game. Built with HTML, CSS, Javasctipt, and jQuery.

## Instructions
* Once you have entered the game there is a directions button.
* If you are familiar with this game you know what to do!
* Mine is a little bit different though!
* Instead of having the four crystals contained to small squares, I had displayed them throughout the entire page.
* Clicking any dinosaur on the page will genreate a random random.
* By clicking on the dinosaurs you are genereating a number closer and closer to the one you are supposed to match.
* If you clicked on the correct amount of dinosaurs your number should match the one generated and you'll get a growl!
* If not, the pteradactly will come and take you away.
* A new game is started by simply clicking on the dinosaurs.
